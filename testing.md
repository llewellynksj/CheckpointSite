All non textual content had alternative text or title so descriptions are read out to screen readers.

HTML page lang attribute has been set to English.

Aria properties have been implemented correctly.
WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed.

#### Validator Testing

All pages were run through the w3 HTML Validator. Initially there were some errors due to stray script tags, misuse of headings within spans and some unclosed elements. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation.

Due to the django templating language code used in the HTML files, these could not be copy and pasted into the validator and due to the secured views, pages with login required or a secured view cannot be validated by direct URI. To test the validation on the files, open the page to validate, right click and view page source. Paste the raw html code into the validator as this will be only the HTML rendered code.


Test - 9 *Description*

Each page has been opened and the HTML code has been put throughout HTML Validator.

Results:

Home Page, Blog Page, Sign up / Register / Login

##### Django / Python testing.

Test - 10 *Description*

Due to a last update the page pep8 used to test the python code is not accessible anymore. Therfore, tests were performed inside the terminal using flake8.

How do you use it?

Firstly, we open GitPod, open our project, and in the terminal we install flake8. 
  - pip install flake8
Once flake8 has been installed we need to run another command in the terminal.
  - python3 -m flake8 <name> (where name is the name of the app i.e: checkpoint).
  
  
The results using flake8 are as following:

thecheckpoint -> No issues have been identify here. Everything works and run as expected.

<img to be added>


the point -> The only errors in this page are generated by the settings.py file.
The reason for this errors is: 
  - 'env' imported but unused -> This is due to the fact that env.py is added to GitIgnore and will not be seen by the flake8.
  - The other errors are in regards with the length of some lines. As I couldn't find a way to split these lines but since they were auto generated and not my own custom code, i hope this is acceptable. Please refer to the below image.
  - The django auto generated code for AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS were showing up as lines too long. As mentioned above, since they were auto generated and not my own custom code, i hope this is acceptable.

blogPoint -> No issues have been identify here, and everything works and run as expected.

### JSHint

Test 10 - *Description*

The JavaScript code was run through JSHint JavaScript validator. This validator flagged up issues with undefined variables as i have forgotten to use the let keyword. This was fixed and the only warnings remained were that they were unused variables. The functions were called via on click from the HTML elements themselves, so are in fact being used.

Other errors have occured because the browser doesn't use ES6 and JSHint couldn't run them.

JSHint Validator:

This errors have been fixed, and now there are not any other errors.



### Lighthouse

<img to be added>

Responsiveness
All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px (and 280px) and upwards as defined in WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Test 11 - *Description*

Test using Lighthouse.

Steps:

1. Open browser and navigate to checkpoint.
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set too responsive and decrease width to 320px and after too 280px.
4. Set the zoom to 50%.
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width.


In this Lighthouse report we can see that everything works as expected. The performance my vary as the blog adds full size pictures in the blog section, also the home page has used gifs for in a carousel post for the hero image. Therfore, this will bring the performance a little bit low. However, this depends on user's internet speed.
    
    
Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched. No horizontal scroll is present. No elements overlaped.

Actual:

Website behaves as expected.

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

1. iPhone 14 Pro Max,
2. iPhone 13 Pro Max,
3. Samsung S9
4. Laptop
5. 32" desktop screen.

Everything works as expected.

Bugs

A bug has been noticed when adding or updating posts on some screen devices.
I will conduct daily tests in order to prevent bugs to appear, and fix them in the 2.0 version of the website.
